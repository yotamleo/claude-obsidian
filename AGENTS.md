# claude-obsidian: Agent Instructions

This repo is a Claude Code plugin **and** an Obsidian vault that builds persistent, compounding knowledge bases using Andrej Karpathy's LLM Wiki pattern. It works with **any AI coding agent** that supports the Agent Skills standard, including Codex CLI, OpenCode, and similar.

Originally built for Claude Code, the skills follow the cross-platform Agent Skills spec. Newer skills (`wiki-fold`, `wiki-ingest`, `wiki-lint`) use only `name` and `description` frontmatter (kepano convention). Some older skills still carry an optional `allowed-tools` field for Claude Code compatibility; cross-platform agents that do not recognize it should ignore it.

## Skills Discovery

All skills live in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Codex / OpenCode / other Agent Skills compatible agents will auto-discover them when you symlink the directory:

```bash
# Codex CLI
ln -s "$(pwd)/skills" ~/.codex/skills/claude-obsidian

# OpenCode
ln -s "$(pwd)/skills" ~/.opencode/skills/claude-obsidian
```

Or run the bundled installer:

```bash
bash bin/setup-multi-agent.sh
```

## Available Skills

| Skill | Trigger phrases |

| `wiki` | `/wiki`, set up wiki, scaffold vault |

## Key Conventions

- **Vault root**: the directory containing `wiki/` and `.raw/`
- **Hot cache**: `wiki/hot.md` (read at session start, updated at session end)
- **Source documents**: `.raw/` (immutable: agents never modify these)
- **Generated knowledge**: `wiki/` (agent-owned, links to sources via wikilinks)
- **Manifest**: `.raw/.manifest.json` tracks ingested sources (delta tracking)

## Bootstrap

When the user opens this project for the first time:

1. Read this file (`AGENTS.md`) and the project `CLAUDE.md` for full context
2. Read `skills/wiki/SKILL.md` for the orchestration pattern
3. If `wiki/hot.md` exists, read it silently to restore recent context
4. If the user types `/wiki` (or "set up wiki"), follow the wiki skill's scaffold workflow
